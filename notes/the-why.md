# Why did we start this project?
Reg and I were were discussing collaborative poetry, and thought it would be fun to create some together. We considered multiple platforms to house the collaboration, but none felt quite right.
Eventually Reg suggested GitHub, and the gears started turning.
It turned into an exploration of HOW
How to create collaboratively here? 
How to use this platform?
Why Github?

Why not?
It's a digital-first space. It is a different way of organising. 

Github feels like it's pushing boundaries and moving into the "land of the coder" (as Reg said) 
A stripped down way of working.
It's the processing, behind the scenes. Pulling the curtain back in a way. The wireframe? It's the brain behind the resulting website/program/art

It makes us ask different questions.
