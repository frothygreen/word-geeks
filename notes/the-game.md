# On the poetry game I'm developing:

## The origin
I was trying to solve a problem. In the summer of 2025, [I created a fanpage for an anime called Yokohama Shopping Log.](https://con-ver-gence.neocities.org/anime/yokohama) 

The show, set some time post-apocalypse, is suffused with lingering shots of the landscape, of the protagonist running her countryside cafe, and her journeys throughout rural Japan. 
It's meant to make you pause, to take a moment and appreciate the transient beauty of life's slow passage.

When I presented my website to the workshop attendees, I wanted to show all parts of the site, and couldn't take the time to share the vision I'd intended. I rushed to scroll down through each .gif, while talking about the themes of slowing down. 

The irony was immediate but in that moment I could not resolve it. So, much later, I was thinking: how can I solve this? 

How can I create a website in which one gets caught up in that movement, a lazy eddy of moving pictures?

As I thought about it, I wondered, "what if after each moment, people could respond, share their thoughts?"
"What if they could share just one word?" 

*Couldn't we create poetry, then?*

This bloomed into a premise for collaborative poetry.

A group of people. A series of videos with sound or music, a pause between each, a moment to record a thought.

Each video's associated words are a line of poetry. Everyone ends up with their own poem based on the video.

Then, why not scramble it? Let's say 3 people are playing this game. 
For each clip they each write 1-4 words.

3 clips, 3-12 words per clip
scramble only the associated words

clip 1: frog, green, swampy streams
clip 2: water rushing, waterfall, a torrential downpour
clip 3: stillness, quiet murmurs, calm

result:  
  
swampy streams  
a torrential downpour  
calm  

(This example is completely made up)
