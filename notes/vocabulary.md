## Commit
Committing a change - is this different to saving a file?  
What does it mean to save something?   
"**Save** is writing data to a storage medium." (Computer Hope)
Saving calls to mind rescue & retention.  

Commmiting calls to mind a promise, a record, a criminal act, an involuntary hospital admission.  
It is "a snapshot of your repository." (Git Guides)  

Committing carries weight. I click commit I am *making a commitment*, I put my self behind my work. Even if it's a minor change to a draft, or a jot in my notebook. The act may be "committing to memory" but the feeling is more than that. I can't think of saving a document as rescuing it, only as recording its current state.  

To commit is a declaration.
