# WRITING
## IN COLLABORATION

In middle school, a couple of friends and I decided to write a story together. We'd email the document around. We'd each write from a different character's perspective, and eventually the stories would merge and we'd end up with something cohesive. 
Well, it all fell apart by the 4th or 5th go-round. For many reasons: lack of direction, too many perspectives, maybe a bit of drama, and an increasing mutual disinterest in writing the story. I know some of us kept writing on our own, I certainly kept writing stories and poetry and had since forgotten about my early attempt at writing with other people. Until

Reg asked back in November 2025 if I wanted to write some collaborative poetry. I immediately agreed. How exciting! We discussed what that could look like, and he shared some history of the art form. We talked about the type of poetry we wanted to create, and shared some inspirations, themes, ideas...

Then came the question -- how? How do we write together? We went through the obvious options: the classic of emailing a document back and forth? Kinda fun, (and reminded me of my initial foray into collaboration)... but no. How about a shared document? We even discussed making a spreadsheet due to a conversation about an internet party which took place on google sheets.

Where was a place that felt suitable?
**These ones didn't feel right.**

...How about GitHub? So we set off on this journey.

But back to collaborative writing and poetry... let's get into a bit of the history:

It can be dated back to feudal Japan, where an art form of Renga emerged. Renga (連歌, linked poem) is a genre of Japanese collaborative poetry in which alternating stanzas, or ku (句), of 5-7-5 and 7-7 morae (sound units or syllables per line) are linked in succession by multiple poets. (Wikipedia)
It is a precursor to the poetic forms of haiku and haikai.

Renga sequences were typically composed live during gatherings of poets, transcribed oral sessions known as rengakai (連歌会), but could also be composed by single poets as mainly textual works. (Wikipedia)

It makes me think of call-and-response in music, but more structured and constrained.

In 1930, French Surrealists wrote a poetry collection together over the span of 5 days. It was called Ralentir Traveaux (slow down construction). No one poem is assigned one author, and there's a playfulness and a strangeness to the verses. I wonder who wrote which parts; what exactly did this collaboration look like in practice? It's a fun mystery, and the denial of individual authorship is intriuging.

Over centuries, many collaborative writing practices have occurred, and you can read more elsewhere...

So let's ask the question: why Github?

We thought it'd be a fun experiment. **A new mode.**
